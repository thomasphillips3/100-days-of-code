# Thomas Phillips 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 8, 2017
##### BeatBox

**Today's Progress**: Learned about SoundPool and assets. Big Nerd Ranch chapters 18 and 19.

**Thoughts:** Starting to take my time and learn subjects more thoroughly, instead of just copying code to finish the chapters quicker.

### Day 2: June 9, 2017
##### Rotation Handling and Styles & Themes

**Today's Progress**: Read about handling rotations in Big Nerd Ranch Chapter 18. There are two different ways - retain the fragment or override onSavedInstanceState(Bundle).

Applied themes and styles to the Beatbox app. Learned to traverse the theme hierarchy to find the appropriate attributes to override.

**Thoughts:** This was helpful in understanding how to customize the look of my app. I definitely want to spend some time specifically on styling. I'm going to get back into the Letters to Myself project.

### Day 3: June 10, 2017
##### Park Players Website

**Today's Progress**: Began uploading all assets to their own S3 bucket. Replaced pics with correct sizes.

**Thoughts:** I have never gotten fully into web development. I think I have always looked at it as easier than other languages, so I never bothered to get good at it. I like that HTML and CSS styling kinda helps me understand Android styling as well.
