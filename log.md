# Thomas Phillips 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 79: December 11, 2017
#### Hugo/ Netlify Blog

**Today's Progress**
- Got a working draft of Park Players v2 up today.
- [Add Netlify CMS to Your Site](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/)

**Thoughts**
This site isn't as pretty as the first one, but it's waaaayy more functional, and extensible. Added CMS login to the website. People can create accounts and view the admin page. The admin page displays and I'm able to create accounts and log in. Next step is to be able to add content through the CMS.

### Day 78: December 10, 2017
#### Getting Started with the Python Search API

**Today's Progress**
- [Installing an Example Search API Application](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/training/fts_intro/lesson1)

**Thoughts**
Spent some time reading about Google Cloud Platform. I get it better than last time I looked at it, because I've been working with AWS and Netlify. After a while, I decided I was wasting my time, and went back to working with Netlify. Well...not wasting my time, but I could better direct my energy to one of the platforms I'm already working with.

### Day 77: December 9, 2017
#### Hugo/ Netlify Blog

**Progress**
I've been working on this every day since Nov 28, but haven't logged anything here. I created a new blog for Park Players, using a Hugo theme. So far, I have set up the archetypes and content types. I'm currently in the process of importing all old blog posts to the new site. After that, I'm setting up CMS so we can update the site easily.

### Day 76: November 28, 2017
#### Hugo/ Netlify Blog

**Today's Progress**
- Created a new Hugo blog
- I got an error when I tried to build. Couldn't figure out why before I went to sleep

**Thoughts**
I had some trouble building my site. Did a lot of debugging. It made me slow down and understand each step of the tutorial I was following. I performed a docker build locally to debug my error. [Here's the log](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hardcore-allen-023d80/deploys/5a1e589a0b79b7055ed77c40).

```
docker pull netlify/build ;
git clone https://github.com/netlify/build-image ;
cd build-image ;

### Day 62: October 29, 2017
#### JAMStack Tutorial - Full site using Netlify & Hugo

**Today's Progress**
- Added Drinks page
- Added Gallery page
- Played around with the CMS, creating and deleting things from the menu
- Created a reservation form
- Checked out Netlify's Notifications

**Thoughts**
Finally finished this today. The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSts93C9UeE) was only like 30 min, but I took 10 days to really absorb and learn what I was going through. I feel confident that I can build and deploy a static site with CMS and continuous deployment now. Got a few ideas for this already.

After deploying, I noticed that my content wasn't loading on the site after I added it in the CMS admin portal. [This comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSts93C9UeE&lc=UgzK9jle0_5qtkdsrX14AaABAg.8YR5UgXbcVp8YT2Q21HlLR) on the video told me that I need to manually upgrade the Hugo version in the Netlify Dashboard by adding a new build environment variable that sets `HUGO_VERSION`'s value to `0.29`

**Today's Progress**
- Read [Netlify CMS Docs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/)
- Added Netlify Identity widget using script injection
- Enabled Identity Service in Netlify
- Fixed the path to my GitHub repo in `config.yml`. I had the full URL instead of just the relative path.

**Thoughts**
So when I finished last night, I was able to get authenticated with GitHub OAuth, but the CMS admin page wouldn't load. I went back through all the docs and blogs but couldn't figure out the problem. I realized it was with the `config.yml` file again. The `backend`

### Day 57: October 19, 2017
#### JAMstack Tutorial - Full site using Netlify & Hugo

**Today's Progress**
- Built and deployed a site using Netlify, which I had never heard of before.

**Thoughts**
JAMStack is pretty dope. I learned a lot about static sites and static site generators. I stayed up really late trying to fix a bug where my Food page wouldn't load...I named the page `imperial-roll.md` instead of `imperial-rolls.md` ![failmoji](res/failmoji.png)

### Day 56: October 14, 2017
#### Baby Monitor

**Today's Progress**
- Finished setting up networking
- Compiled [`picam`](https://github.com/iizukanao/picam/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
- Created a bash script to start Picam
- Created a bash script to run Picam at startup
- Installed [`nginx`](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/) to expose the video stream to allow connections to view it

**Thoughts**
I read about how networking has changed in Stretch. I thought about the baby monitor, and how I want to access it. For now, I opted to not make a static IP. I might change this later, if there's a need.

I noticed the instructions I was following were for Jessie.

```
wget https://github.com/iizukanao/picam/releases/download/v1.4.6/picam-1.4.6-binary-jessie.tar.xz
tar xvf picam-1.4.6-binary-jessie.tar.xz
cp picam-1.4.6-binary-jessie/picam ~/picam/
```

Since I'm using Stretch, I deduced this may be the reason I was getting an empty list when I ran `arecord -l`.

In the middle of this process, I realized that I'd have to cross-compile for Raspberry Pi, and I need a more powerful Linux computer for that. Since I don't feel like setting up a VM on my MacBook or setting up my Ubuntu server, I'll just follow the [Using a Binary Release](https://github.com/iizukanao/picam#using-a-binary-release) instructions.

After getting the binary installed and set up, I realized that I was getting an empty list of audio devices because I don't have any audio devices lol duhhhh.

I got the stream to work in VLC. The web player works in Safari, but not Chrome. I [left a comment](http://disq.us/p/1n0kosh), but I think I'm good for now.

### Day 55: October 11, 2017
#### Baby Monitor

**Today's Progress**
- Formatted SD card with [SD Association's Formatting Tool](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/eula_mac/)
-  Installed Raspbian with NOOBS

**Thoughts**
- I did the full format instead of quick. This got me interested in how formatting actually works, so I took a look at the [GParted code](https://github.com/GNOME/gparted). I didn't understand any of it.

- I was able to get `raspistill` to work, but `arecord -l` gave me an empty list. I decided to quit for tonight since I at least know the camera is working. Must be a software issue.

- Added SSID to `/etc/network/interfaces`
- Upgraded Raspbian
- [Installed desktop](http://lightshowpi.org/)

The ribbon cable to my breakout board didn't fit on the Raspberry Pi 3, so I used the older one. I hadn't powered this one on in a while, so I had to add my new SSID to the network interfaces file. Once I had network, I installed `lightdm` and upgraded Raspbian to the latest version.

Created a [console calculator](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/java-8-essential-training/challenge-creating-a-simple-calculator-application?u=2011276) in Java.

**Thoughts**
This project was pretty simple. I'm taking this [Java 8 Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/java-8-essential-training?u=2011276) on LinkedIn Learning to fill in some of my Java understanding. It's redundant in some places, but worth it for some of the things I've missed in my self-taught coding education.

- Debugging - I didn't know how to debug in IntelliJ IDEA. Now I know how to use the debugger - setting breakpoints and watching variables.

### Day 40: September 6, 2017
#### iOS Calculator

**Today's Progress**
#### CS193P IOS APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT WINTER 2017
[Assignment 1 Required Tasks](https://github.com/thomasphillips3/cs193p-Winter-2017/blob/master/problemsets/Programming_Project_1_Calculator.pdf)
1. Get the Calculator working as demonstrated in lectures 1 and 2.
2. Your Calculator already works with floating point numbers (e.g. if you touch 3 √∑ 4 =, it will properly show 0.75), however, there is no way for the user to enter a floating point number directly. Fix this by allowing legal floating point numbers to be entered (e.g. ‚Äú192.168.0.1‚Äù is not a legal floating point number!). You will need to have a ‚Äú.‚Äù button in your calculator. Don‚Äôt worry too much about precision or significant digits in this assignment (doing so is Extra Credit).
3. Add some more operations buttons to your calculator such that it has at least a dozen operations total (it can have even more if you like). You can choose whatever operations appeal to you. The buttons must arrange themselves nicely in portrait and landscape modes on all iPhone 6‚Äôs and 7‚Äôs.
4. Use color to make your UI look nice. At the very least, your operations buttons must be a different color than your keypad buttons, but otherwise you can use color in whatever way you think looks nice.

### Day 39: September 5, 2017
#### Park Players Website

**Today's Progress**
Finished first drafts of Home, Auditions, Shows, and Contact sections. It's at a point now where we COULD launch it. I suppose this is a MVP.

**Thoughts**

### Day 38: September 4, 2017
#### Park Players Website

**Today's Progress**
Been working on this website for a few weeks and haven't updated progress here.

**Thoughts**
- I'm getting better at determining discrete tasks so I can estimate how long it'll take me to complete.
- I am learning AWS by implementing what I understand so far. Right now I'm only using S3, but as the website grows, maybe I'll have the opportunity to implement other services. I definitely want to get my AWS certifiation this year.

**********

#### Developing iOS Apps with Swift
**Today's Progress**
- Lecture 3: More Swift and the Foundation Framework
- Read [Swift API Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Read [The Swift Programming Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097)

**Thoughts**
- Optionals are really strange. I think I had the hardest time understanding this.
- Tuples are new to me, but pretty easy to understand.

### Day 37: August 17, 2017
#### Android Background Services
**Today's Progress**
Made it through another couple sections of **Chapter 26: Background Services** in the BigNerdRanch Android Programming Book.

**Thoughts**
I don't know why, but every cell in the `RecyclerView` keeps refreshing every time a new image is downloaded. I think I'm doing something wrong with `GSON`.

- [`attachInterrupt()`](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AttachInterrupt)

**Thoughts**
I was on a plane, so didn't get to build the hardware to go with this sketch, but I get the idea. I'm still trying to understand the significance of having dedicated interrupt pins vs using a regular GPIO pin as an interrupt.

#### Android
**Today's Progress**
Read [What is 'Context' on Android?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3572463/what-is-context-on-android)

**Thoughts**
Today I just felt like reading up on basics and not doing any code. This was very helpful because I've never read much about what Context is, I've just used it. Now that I have some context on Context...I feel uh...better.

### Day 34: August 4, 2017
#### Python on a Plane

**Today's Progress**
Built a temperature converter in Python using Tkinter for the GUI.

**Thoughts**
Read this book Programming the Raspberry Pi: Getting Started with Python (Electronics) on my Kindle. I'm glad that it shows how to use `grid` instad of just `pack`. Also glad that it shows how to use Tkinter with classes.

### Day 32: August 2, 2017
#### Android services
**Today's Progress**
Implemented a background service to update the UI with search results.

**Thoughts**
It works, but it's kinda fucked up tho. Results aren't cleared, and they cycle a few times/ second. So if I search for "dogs", "butts", "rihanna", and "kangaroos", I see each of those images, continuously cycling through each cell of the grid. It's like the weirdest brainwash video ever. I'ma go to sleep now.

#### HockeyApp and TKinter

**Today's Progress:**
- I found out how to download the latest APK via the [HockeyApp Python API](http://hockeyapp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
- The URL I got from the JSON response redirects to another page so I had to figure out How can I get the final redirect URL when using `urllib2.urlopen`
- After I built the download URL from the redirect URL, I used `urllib.URLopener().retrieve` to download the APK.
- [Python Tutorial 5: Data Structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
- [Python Tutorial 9: Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)

**Thoughts**
I'm super excited to have gotten the HockeyApp API to download an APK! I found reading through the code was more helpful than the documentation this time around.

### Day 22: July 15, 2017
#### Debugging Android

**Thoughts**
I noticed my local placeholder image wasn't showing. I had only ever tested this code while in airplane mode, and suspect that the lack of internet connection is causing the problem. Here's what I think is happening
- My `AsyncTask` (`FlickrFetcher.fetchitems()`) fails to download, and throws an exception
- Because of this failure, `FetchItemsTask.onPostExecute(...)` doesn't execute
- `setupAdapter()` is never called
- `mPhotoRecyclerView.setAdapter(...)` is also never called, so the RecyclerView's adapter is never set
- `PhotoAdapter` constructor is not called, so the lifecycle method `onCreateViewHolder(...)` is never called, so the layout is never inflated.

Basically, if there's no internet connection, the user won't see anything right now. This will probably be addressed later in the book.

**********

#### Android Background Thread

**Today's Progress**:
Create a background thread to handle the longer-running background process of downloading images. AsyncTask isn't meant for long-running processes.

#### Android Paging Challenge

**Today's Progress**:
- Implemented OnVerticalScrollListener from [this SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30410605/270847).

**Thoughts**
I'm not sure if `OnVerticalScrollListener` is implemented correctly. I put a log message in `onScrolledToBottom()`, but it never fired. I'm not sure if this is because I'm on a plane and can't fetch data from Flickr, but I saved it under a new branch so I can continue working on the next chapter and come back to this later.

### Day 20: July 6, 2017
#### Python Tkinter

**Today's Progress**:
- Created an app to issue ADB commands from a Tkinter interface

**Thoughts**
I learned about callbacks and lambdas in Python. Trying to stay focused on completing one task completely before moving on to something else. I notice that if I find a new way of doing something while I'm in the middle of it, I often get distracted by the options instead of just finishing the way I started.

In Python, I have to define a function above where it's used. Java isn't as picky.

#### GSON

**Today's Progress**: Converted the parseItems method to use [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) instead of parsing manually. I read [this forum](https://forums.bignerdranch.com/t/using-gson/7849/5?u=thomasphillips3) to help.

#### Python Tkinter

**Today's Progress**:
Got [Tkinter GUI Application Development Blueprints](https://www.amazon.com/Tkinter-GUI-Application-Development-Blueprints/dp/1785889737).

**Thoughts**
I learned the difference between `from tkinter import *`, `import tkinter`, and `import tkinter as tk`. Hadn't really considered this distinction before, but it makes sense.

The grid system will take some getting used to, but I think I see its merits already. Seems to be simple and powerful at the same time.

### Day 18: July 4, 2017
#### Chapter 23: Photo Gallery Networking

### Day 17: July 3, 2017

#### Chapter 23: Photo Gallery Networking

**Today's Progress**:
- Created basic UI of PhotoGallery app
- Wrote class to handle fetching data over the network in a background thread
- Created Flickr API key
- Read Flickr API. Specifically [flickr.photos.getRecent](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getRecent.html)

**Thoughts**
I feel like this is the starting point of learning some real shit. Networking and tasks are two areas I haven't studied in-depth yet, and I'm very excited to learn and implement this further. I think this is where I can start to branch out and start brainstorming my own project ideas. There's a pretty good opportunity for creating clients to display web content in new, interesting ways.

### Day 11: June 26, 2017
#### Accessing Google APIs

**Today's Progress**:
- Read and worked through Google [Accessing Google APIs guide](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/api-client)
- Learned how to set up Google Play Services in an Android app
- Learned how to make synchronous and asynchronous calls

**Thoughts**
This is good for helping me understand how Android Studio handles dependencies. I've been having some confusion with Gradle and adding dependencies. Now, I know the process
- Make sure the Google Support Repository is available on the local machine using SDK Manager
- Add Google Support Repository to the project by adding a new build rule under `dependencies` for the latest version of `play-services` in the app's `build.gradle` file

Adding the Google Play Support library to an Android app has helped me understand what I need to do to link the the G++ compiler to the OpenSSL Library. I'm on a plane again, so I can't look up the exact command right now, but I think it's `g++ -l /path-to/openssl`.

**********

#### Mongoose

**Today's Progress**:
- [Mongoose Getting Started Guide](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/)

- Finished [Serialization (pt. 2)](http://davidederosa.com/basic-blockchain-programming/serialization-part-two/index.html)

**Thoughts**
- Studied the example on hashes (ex-hashes.c). Changed the code to get different hashes. I understand the example pretty well. The hardest part so far was learning to include the OpenSSL library during compilation. My C++ experience in Engin101 at U of M was brief. I learned how to include header files, but not external libraries. I got it to work with `gcc -I /usr/local/opt/openssl/include/ -L /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/ ex-hashes.c -lcrypto`. SUUUUPER excited!!!

- Learned about encoding variables of different lengths with `varints`

**Thoughts**
I wrote a simple app to find the GCD, and remembered things about C++ I had forgotten. I initially wrote my gcd function below main(). I forgot if I want to do it this way, I have to declare the function above main. The other option is to just put main under gcd in the code.

### Day 7: June 18, 2017
#### Remove static images - Park Players Website

**Today's Progress:** Since I'm hosting in AWS, I want to only edit the HTML file, and store all assets (images, CSS, JS files) in AWS or in a CDN.

**Thoughts** While updating the images, I noticed some formatting issues have arisen. I'm using GitHub to track issues now. Part of becoming a better coder is learning to use the tools.

### Day 6: June 13, 2017
#### C day

**Today's Progress**: I realized my understanding of C is mad rusty. Decided to look at a bunch of C project repos on GitHub.
* [Terminal Games](https://github.com/stillmotion/terminal-games)
* [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)
* [Darknet: Open Source Neural Networks in C](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet√∑)

Also, I played around with C in XCode a bit.

**Thoughts** I want the experience of learning to program like I should have had in college. I am going to take my time and understand all the code I read. Going through all these C project repositories gave me a sense of how C looks, and what people use it for, versus newer languages (Java, Swift, JavaScript, Python, etc).

So I'm going to start with the Terminal Games repo. The games seem to be just outside of the bounds of my understanding. It'll challenge me, but not discourage me.

### Day 5: June 12, 2017
#### Serialization in C++

**Today's Progress**: [Serialization (pt. 1)](http://davidederosa.com/basic-blockchain-programming/serialization-part-one/) of [Davide De Rosa's Blockchain Programming Tutorial](http://davidederosa.com/basic-blockchain-programming/).

**Thoughts** I started reading this a while ago, but wanted to actually run the code. This was a learning process as well, getting my computer set up for C++. I found a couple plug-ins for Atom. I think I'll try to make that work.

I am making good progress, but going to sleep now...at 2:40 am. The last issue I encountered was [Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18751868/undefined-symbols-for-architecture-x86-64-compiling-problems). I'll work on it tomorrow.

### Day 4: June 11, 2017
#### Park Players Website

**Today's Progress**: Began uploading all assets to their own S3 bucket. Replaced pics with correct sizes.

**Thoughts** I have never gotten fully into web development. I think I have always looked at it as easier than other languages, so I never bothered to get good at it. I like that HTML and CSS styling kinda helps me understand Android styling as well.

### Day 2: June 9, 2017
#### Rotation Handling and Styles & Themes

**Today's Progress**: Read about handling rotations in Big Nerd Ranch Chapter 18. There are two different ways - retain the fragment or override onSavedInstanceState(Bundle).

Applied themes and styles to the Beatbox app. Learned to traverse the theme hierarchy to find the appropriate attributes to override.

**Thoughts** This was helpful in understanding how to customize the look of my app. I definitely want to spend some time specifically on styling. I'm going to get back into the Letters to Myself project.

### Day 1: June 8, 2017
#### BeatBox

**Today's Progress**: Learned about SoundPool and assets. Big Nerd Ranch chapters 18 and 19.

**Thoughts** Starting to take my time and learn subjects more thoroughly, instead of just copying code to finish the chapters quicker.
